# malware_detection
Permissions based Android malware detection using classification algorithms.

## Experiments
0. train/test split. We separate 20% of the data as the final holdout test set
1. feature selection. Analyze random forest based feature importance scores, and CV model performance selecting the n top features

## Source Code (src)
### src.data_processing
1. feature_selection.py -- defines functions/classes for feature selection and calculation of feature importance scores
### src.models
1. evaluate.py -- evaluates model performance (accuracy, f1, precision, recall, auc roc)
2. k_fold_cv.py -- defines classes for evaluating performance over k-fold cross validation
